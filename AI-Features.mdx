## The Missing Layer in Prediction Markets

Prediction markets have proven demand, but liquidity provision remains:

- fragmented  
- manual  
- capital-inefficient  
- inaccessible to most users  

Flowlayer introduces a dedicated liquidity layer designed to:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Users">
    - One-click liquidity strategies  
    - Risk-aware automation  
    - Passive yield exposure  
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Markets">
    - Deeper books  
    - Reduced spreads  
    - More stable pricing  
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ecosystem">
    - Liquidity routing infrastructure  
    - Incentive distribution layer  
    - Data intelligence network  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Long-Term Goal

Flowlayer becomes the default liquidity coordination layer for prediction markets globally.
